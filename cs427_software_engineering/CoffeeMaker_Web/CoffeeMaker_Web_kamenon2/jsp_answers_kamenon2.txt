User Story : 
	Title: Add Inventory 
	AccTest: addInventory 1 
	Priority: 1 
	Story Points: 2
	
Implementation details as below:

1) The modified version of add_inventory consists of an enhanced page for adding the 4 items (coffee, sugar, milk & chocolate) in whole
numbers only. There is no decimal number support & for the JSP throws an exception of 
javax.servlet.ServletException: edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker.exceptions.InventoryException: Units of coffee must be a positive integer.
Exception handling is left for future enhancements.

2) Instead of showing just a message, the page shows an updated quantity at the top of the section. There is no fancy javascripting
for this and its a simple mechanism of returning the count once the method returns.

3) Since reducing the quantity is part of Purchase Beverage section, there is no mechanism right now to reduce the quantity.
Since the JSP takes only positive integers for now, as part of future enhancements, setting negative numbers shall reduce the quantity
as part of settings corrections to the quantity.

4) The page has been modified differently than what has been shared in the new release version mentioned in MP1.

As mentioned in the http://realsearchgroup.org/SEMaterials/tutorials/jsp/jsp_tutorial.html 
& http://realsearchgroup.org/SEMaterials/tutorials/coffee_maker/ only story to "Add Inventory" is attempted here.
Purchase beverage is not attempted as its mentioned as a seperate story.
