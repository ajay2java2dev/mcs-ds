# University of Illinois (MCS-DS), other coursera courses & lecture materials
multiple samples and course exercise files for different lectures have been captured here. Datascience is a vast subject and multiple libraries for Python and R are available for students to use. The only issue is that since there are lot of information out there, it becomes really difficult for begginers to get to actual coding implementation part.

The contents in this repository are course subject vice and are open for public to contribute.
